# SLT Bug Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains a Streamlit dashboard for analysing bug reports in the SLT Selfcare app.

## Running Locally

Install dependencies and start Streamlit:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/dashboard/app.py
```

The application can load environment variables from a `.env` file. The
processing scripts use `OPENAI_API_KEY` for accessing the OpenAI API, so a
minimal `.env` might look like:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

## Deployment Notes

When deploying on platforms such as Streamlit Community Cloud or other headless environments, include the `.streamlit/config.toml` file in the repository. This file ensures the server runs in headless mode and disables CORS, which is required for remote access:

```toml
[server]
headless = true
enableCORS = false
```

Having these settings in place lets the dashboard start automatically without needing a browser on the server and prevents CORS issues when accessing the app.
