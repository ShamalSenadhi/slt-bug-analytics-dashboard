Excellent service,0
"This is the worst app I ever used, I was in an online class and I immediately needed some extra GB. But nothing works in this app when I chose the amount of GB. Also, when I tried to sign out from this app I could not sign out. What I don't understand is that despite being an organization which works with technology, they cannot make a proper app. I am completely disappointed.",1

"Giving this app 4 stars because even though other aspects of the app is on point it has a major flaw and that is this app does not automatically update my SLTfiber data usage real time insted it update todays data usage as tomorrow's data usage and that is confusing and hard to track, if SLT needs to be transparent and a reliable app they need to give that information real time.",0
"Though it is generally ok, it gets stuck frequently.",1
I love SLT ‚ù§‚ù§,0
"App is not that bad. However, the quality of the customer service of SLT is extremely poor overall. I am using SLT because I don't have any other choice at the moment.",0
Most of the time it says service unavailable!,1
"Worst app ever ! Getting unavailable service all the time and Application keeps getting stuck, i would encourage you to work on your mobile app next time rather than giving 'shakaboom' packages.",1
When i add extra data it finishers in no time. I am confused my usage is 1gb or less for a day I added 10gb on 17th August . 22nd my balance is only 1gb. How come this happen?üôÑ They are faking with our money. And worest is non of their apps works properly and does not provide information we need to check. We need to see our day and night balance seperately and extra gb usage seperately. Worse service ever....üò°,0
My Slt app is not working in samsung android phone. Installed several times but same.,1
"What was wrong with the previous SLT Selfcare app? The UI is still convoluted and messy, the color choice is dank and it does not match with the nice blue colored bootup splash screen. I stumbled up here since I saw an error saying ""Service Currently Unavailavle"" but the web version is working like a charm as if nothing has happened.",1
"Worst service from slt, they will never attend your complaints",0

"I've been trying to log into my account. But it showed ""Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Service will be available soon."" üôÇ I contacted the SLT hotline after waiting for almost 16 minutes. But they couldn't fix that problem either. Disappointed. üëé Please give the old app back. üòÖ",1
User interface is horrible sometimes it bugs when i purchase extra GB. Needed to be upgraded!,0
It is easy to control the data,0
"Not worth even a single star. The signal connection is terrible, and the customer service is poor. They know they have a poor connection and that customers are facing issues, but they act like there's no problem. We're paying, but the data gets used up quickly without proper coverage. SLT is turning out to be just as bad as Lanka Bell. The coordinators and staff at Aluthmawatha are very lazy. They don‚Äôt provide any solutions and just tell us to go to the head office because they themselves do",1

"I was using this app. My bill is also linked to it. However, my details were automatically deleted and then I tried to enter my telephone number, account number and my ID. But i got an error message saying my ID is wrong...",1
Why can't you guys show the usage simply in MB or GB instead of the percentage. One more thing this app only shows me the usage of the day bundle and the usage of the whole bundle. It is confusing. If you guys issue data as day and night bundles why don't you show the usage like that...,1
After update app suddenly closed. Tried to completely uninstalled and reinstalled but problem still persit.,1

Terrible app. When I open the app always it always say Service Temporary Unavailable. Can't get any services from the app. As a leading telecommunication company in the country SLT should ashamed their self about this app.,1
"Unprofessional, crazy and unpractical App. When registration started always say invalid username and invalid password. But unfortunately still SLT is sleeping without rectifying the App. Please do not insult your valuable customers since you are survive form them.

Very bad and useless app....can't even log into it....do not even install it...it is a wastage of your data,1
Very bad cannot log in,1
"Basically, yes it does the job. But the User interface is awful and is very frustrating to use. The animations are choppy when switching from windows and applying commands. But where it needs the most improvements is the organisation of buttons, its all over the place and is not catogarised. For example; why is there a whole separate section for Complaints, it's not something that users will use all the time (could have been in a sub menu and the section replaced with something more important.)",0
This is sucks,0
"Although the app is really useful, user experience is awful. Full of bugs, system doesn't work when you need it. Very slow.",1

"They market themselves like they are the only one best ISP in the country. But they can't even maintain their own app. If I open the app 10 times per a day- 8 times actually it is broken. Says service is temporary unavailable or some sh**. These days they are giving an Christmas offer with free 50gb social media package for 14days. Even it's free, I can't use it because my main package data is reached out the limit. I mean what's there in free?? Why they've became this cheap?",1
I just paid the November month bill thru this app and ended up getting freezed but the amount for deducted from the bank account. The app is really useless garbage since app getting freeze during payment is horrible. I need an immediate solution.,1
